# 🎬 Glimpsify: Extract PPT Slides from any Educational Video

**A Video-to-PDF Frame Extraction Tool**

❌ Watch an entire 34 minutes long lecture video on YouTube? Naah 👎 \
✅ Get PDF notes of screenshots of important parts of the video instead? Hell yessss! 👌

That's what Glimpsify does! 💻

You pass it YouTube link 🔗 of the lecture video 🎥 and it gives you the PDF notes 📑 of the key parts of the video.
Yes with all the visuals - diagrams, charts, formulas - which no summarizer in the market gives!

## Extracting Most Information Frame

Pass a YouTube Video link and get the screenshots of the frame which has the most information content (like if someone is explaining with the help of a PPT, capture screenshot when all the text of one slide of PPT has animated in)

Frame with most information it can possibly have

This frame can have more information and thus not the most information frame
