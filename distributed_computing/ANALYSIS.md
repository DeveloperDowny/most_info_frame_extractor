To make the existing codebase suitable for distributed computing, you need to consider several key aspects that will allow the application to leverage multiple nodes or machines for parallel execution. Here's a high-level outline of the steps and changes you might need to implement:

### 1. **Identify Parallelizable Tasks**
   - Break down the application into smaller tasks that can run independently. These tasks are often units of work like frame processing, OCR execution, or video downloads.

### 2. **Choose a Distributed Computing Framework**
   - Frameworks like Apache Kafka and Spark, or libraries like Dask, Celery, and Ray, can be used for distributed task scheduling and execution. Your choice will depend on your use case, such as whether you need real-time processing, batch processing, or task scheduling.

### 3. **Modify the Code for Task Distribution**
   - Refactor code segments that are currently sequential and suitable for parallel execution. For example, processing frames from a video or extracting text using OCR can be distributed.
   - Use the chosen framework’s API to distribute these tasks across multiple nodes.
   - Ensure that shared resources (such as files or database connections) are handled properly to avoid conflicts.

### 4. **Implement Messaging or Task Scheduling**
   - Use message brokers like RabbitMQ, Kafka, or task queues in Celery to distribute tasks.
   - Define how tasks are communicated among nodes – usually through a producer-consumer model, where tasks are produced by a central node and consumed by worker nodes.

### 5. **Data Storage and Access**
   - Consider using distributed file systems (like HDFS or Amazon S3) for storing large files or outputs from distributed tasks.
   - If your application accesses a database, use a distributed database system or ensure that your RDBMS is capable of handling concurrent connections efficiently.

### 6. **Error Handling and Fault Tolerance**
   - Incorporate mechanisms to handle task failures, retries, and ensure the system can gracefully recover from node failures.
   - Implement checkpoints or a state management system to track the progress of distributed tasks and enable recovery from failures.

### 7. **Testing and Monitoring**
   - Test the distributed system in a controlled environment to ensure tasks are correctly partitioned and executed on different nodes.
   - Implement monitoring, logging, and alerting to track application performance and detect bottlenecks or failures.

### Code Example Adjustments

Here's how you might adapt an existing portion of your code for a distributed framework like Ray:

```python
import ray
from processed_frame import ProcessedFrame

# Initialize Ray
ray.init()

@ray.remote
def process_frame_with_ocr(frame_data, ocr_strategy):
    """Process a single frame using the OCR strategy."""
    return ProcessedFrame.from_video_segment(frame_data, ocr_strategy)

def distribute_frame_processing(frames, ocr_strategy):
    tasks = []
    for frame in frames:
        # Distribute tasks to different workers
        task = process_frame_with_ocr.remote(frame, ocr_strategy)
        tasks.append(task)

    # Gather results once all tasks are completed
    processed_frames = ray.get(tasks)
    return processed_frames

# Assuming `frames` is the list of frames to process and `ocr_strategy` is provided.
processed_frames = distribute_frame_processing(frames, ocr_strategy)
```

### Final Notes

- **Scalability:** Ensure your architecture can scale with the addition of more nodes.
- **Security:** Consider securing your distributed environment, including communication between nodes and access to shared resources.
- **Network Latency:** Be mindful of the network latency and bandwidth, as they can affect distributed task performance.

This transformation will facilitate the parallel processing of tasks and make efficient use of multiple computing resources, enhancing the overall performance of your application.
