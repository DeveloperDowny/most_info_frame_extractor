       " <KeyMoment: Less parameters is better than more parameters Don't be afraid to use introduce parameter object if needed | 0:01:19>,\n",
       " <KeyMoment: Command and query separation Queries return something Commands change the state of the system and don't return. | 0:01:56>,\n",
       " <KeyMoment: Encapsulation is a friend Hide your state. Use smart objects. | 0:02:35>,\n",
       " <KeyMoment: Polymorphism is not always a friend Don't use polymorphism if it leads to complexity | 0:03:11>,\n",
       " <KeyMoment: 20. Always use TDD | 0:04:28>,\n",
       " <KeyMoment: Data Clumps - Some fields seem to naturally group together. Use Extract Class to put them in the same class or introduce Parameter Object. | 0:10:06>,\n",
       " <KeyMoment: Lazy class-A class that isn't doing enough to be worth having. Usually a side effect of refactoring. Use Inline Class. | 0:10:42>,\n",
       " <KeyMoment: Middle man - The opposite of message chains. Too much encapsulation leads to a lot of middle men hiding the chain. Use Remove middle man or Inline Method if possible | 0:11:21>,\n",
       " <KeyMoment: Comment - Comments mean you failed to express yourself with code. Use extract method and take advantage of naming things to express yourself. | 0:12:02>,\n",
       " <KeyMoment: Extract method - the most important refactoring technique. Basic use of Indirection to functions code. | 0:12:11>,\n",
       " <KeyMoment: Split temporary variable-a variable is assigned more than once, not inside a loop or collecting a temporary variable; split it into multiple variables with proper names | 0:13:01>,\n",
       " <KeyMoment: Move Method - A method is using another class more than it's own- it suffers from feature envy move it to the class it is envious upon | 0:13:44>,\n",
       " <KeyMoment: Hide Delegate - Encapsulate to avoid train wrecks, or Message chains, even if just using wrappers. From object A you get Object from with you get object to call method Encapsulate the state of B. Add to it method even if it is just a wrapper for CXO. | 0:14:19>,\n",
       " <KeyMoment: Self encapsulate field -add getters and setters | 0:15:06>,\n",
       " <KeyMoment: Replace Array with Object. An array has elements that mean different things- , low cohesion. Turn the array into an object with a field for each element. | 0:15:47>,\n",
       " <KeyMoment: Replace Magic Number with Symbollo Constant Never use numbers and strings in code as types or special meaning. Use constants instead. | 0:16:31>,\n",
       " <KeyMoment: Replace Type Code with Class. Instead of keeping Strings and Numbers for certain types like Blood Type move them into their own Blood Type class | 0:17:06>,\n",
