### Outline for IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies Research Paper

#### **1. Abstract**

- All of the learning these days majorly takes place through the medium of YouTube video and typical of those are the ones where a presenter teaches with slides. This project extract these key slides from such videos efficiently. This is done by identifying peak points in the temporal signal generated by calculating the length of textual content found using OCR on frames ingested frame by frame. We employed and compared results of various peak detection algorithm and also made analogy to stock market trading strategy to identify peak points. We found that the profit maximization method gave the best results. This project can be used to summarize educational videos and help students navigate through the content easily which is especially important for last moment revision for examinations.

#### **2. Introduction**

- **Problem Statement**:
  With most of the learning happening via educational videos on YouTube which are typically taught using slides, many summarization tools have thus emerged. Many of them give an LLM generated summary but they are devoid of the diagrams and equations that are shown in the video.
  To address this, we embarked on to build a tool that efficiently extracts "key frames" the frames of the video that has the maximum informational contain that it can contain.
- **Objective**:
  - The goal is to autonomously identify as less as frames possible without missing any important information and extract these key frames.
  - We believe this will not only help in streamlined content consumption but also will help you get a preview of the video and you'd be better able to decide you want to go on to view the entire video or not as not all videos present of YouTube have the quality of content you desire. Thus saving lot of time and mental energy.
- **Contributions**:
  - The differentiating approach that we have taken here is focus on lightweight and efficient extraction. Previous research have employed large ML models for key frame extraction which is not only inefficient time wise but also has heavy operational const.
  - In contrast, we've heavily used peak detection algorithms to detect key frames and signal processing techniques like smoothening and filtering and image processing techniques like pixel-wise comparison to improve the accuracy of the tool.

#### **3. Related Work**

- Following approaches have been explored in this domain:

  1. Multimodal Analysis: The Lecture Presentations Multimodal Dataset focuses on understanding multimodal elements in educational videos, combining text, audio, and visual data to extract meaningful insights. This highlights the importance of integrating multiple content forms for comprehensive video summarization.

  2. Automated Analysis: Techniques like those in the Automated Analysis and Indexing of Lecture Videos employ speech-to-text and visual content extraction to create searchable indices, laying the groundwork for structured keyframe-based video summarization.

  3. Deep Learning Approaches: SliTraNet demonstrates the power of Convolutional Neural Networks for detecting slide transitions in lecture videos. This is particularly relevant for educational contexts, where such transitions often signify key changes in content.

  4. Text and Speech Integration: The study on Content-Based Lecture Video Retrieval Using Speech and Video Text Information showcases how combining speech data with on-screen text can improve the retrieval and extraction of relevant video segments.

  5. Sequential Keyframe Extraction: Research like the LMSKE (Large Model-based Sequential Keyframe Extraction) applies similarity matrices and redundancy reduction to identify compact yet informative keyframe sets, demonstrating the efficacy of advanced statistical and deep learning techniques for video summarization. The LMSKE method outperformed other techniques like VSUMM and INCEPTION in metrics such as F1 scores, fidelity, and compression ratio.

  - The main gaps in these researches is lack of simplicity and efficiency. All of the employment of deep learning, clustering algorithms are likely not to produce fast results to the user.
  - And none have tried signal processing methods, specifically peak detection methods to approach this problem.
  - We present a novel approach which uses peak detection algorithms and we've also added a comparative study of the different peak detection algorithms we used in this approach
