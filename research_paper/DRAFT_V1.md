### Outline for IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies Research Paper

#### **1. Abstract**
- All of the learning these days majorly takes place through the medium of YouTube video and typical of those are the ones where a presenter teaches with slides. This project extract these key slides from such videos efficiently. This is done by identifying peak points in the temporal signal generated by calculating the length of textual content found using OCR on frames ingested frame by frame. We employed and compared results of various peak detection algorithm and also made analogy to stock market trading strategy to identify peak points. We found that the profit maximization method gave the best results. This project can be used to summarize educational videos and help students navigate through the content easily which is especially important for last moment revision for examinations.
 
#### **2. Introduction**
   - **Problem Statement**:
      With most of the learning happening via educational videos on YouTube which are typically taught using slides, many summarization tools have thus emerged. Many of them give an LLM generated summary but they are devoid of the diagrams and equations that are shown in the video.
      To address this, we embarked on to build a tool that efficiently extracts "key frames" the frames of the video that has the maximum informational contain that it can contain.  
   - **Objective**:
     - The goal is to autonomously identify as less as frames possible without missing any important information and extract these key frames.
     - We believe this will not only help in streamlined content consumption but also will help you get a preview of the video and you'd be better able to decide you want to go on to view the entire video or not as not all videos present of YouTube have the quality of content you desire. Thus saving lot of time and mental energy.
   - **Contributions**:
     - The differentiating approach that we have taken here is focus on lightweight and efficient extraction. Previous research have employed large ML models for key frame extraction which is not only inefficient time wise but also has heavy operational const.
     - In contrast, we've heavily used peak detection algorithms to detect key frames and signal processing techniques like smoothening and filtering and image processing techniques like pixel-wise comparison to improve the accuracy of the tool.
