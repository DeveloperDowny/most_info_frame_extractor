### **Outline for IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies Research Paper**

#### **1. Abstract**

The increasing use of YouTube for educational purposes has highlighted the need for efficient tools to summarize video content, especially for videos where presenters teach using slides. This paper introduces a novel approach to extract "key frames" from such videos by identifying peak points in the temporal signal generated through Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of textual content in video frames. Multiple peak detection algorithms were analyzed, and a stock market-inspired profit maximization strategy yielded the best results. This lightweight and efficient approach preserves critical visual information, such as diagrams and equations, often missed by language model-based summarization techniques. The method facilitates streamlined content navigation and enhances last-minute revision processes for students.

#### **2. Introduction**

- **Problem Statement**:  
  Educational videos, particularly those leveraging slide-based presentations, dominate platforms like YouTube. Existing summarization tools primarily rely on text or language models, often neglecting crucial visual elements such as diagrams and equations. This gap underscores the need for a lightweight, efficient solution for extracting high-information content frames directly from video data.

- **Objective**:  
  - Design a tool that autonomously identifies a minimal set of "key frames" without missing critical information.  
  - Enhance user experience by enabling quick previews of video content, thereby saving time and energy, especially in evaluating video quality before investing further attention.  

- **Contributions**:  
  - A novel approach leveraging signal processing techniques and peak detection algorithms for key frame extraction.  
  - Comparative analysis of various peak detection methods, including stock market-inspired strategies for temporal signal analysis.  
  - Demonstration of the method's efficiency in terms of computational resource usage and extraction quality compared to deep learning-based methods.  

- **Structure of the Paper**:  
  A detailed roadmap of related work, methodology, experimental results, applications, limitations, and future scope.

#### **4. Methodology**

- **4.1 Video Processing Pipeline**:  
  Videos are processed at three-second intervals using OpenCV to extract frames.  

- **4.2 Frame Comparison Algorithm**:  
  A pixel-wise comparison algorithm identifies visually identical frames to minimize redundancy. The comparison threshold of 0.5% difference in pixel content was determined empirically for optimal results.  

- **4.3 Text Extraction and Signal Generation**:  
  - OCR extracts text from each frame, generating a temporal signal representing text length variation.  
  - Redundant OCR operations are avoided by reusing results for visually identical frames.  

- **4.4 Key Frame Selection Methods**:  
  1. **Simple Peak Detection**: Basic local maxima detection with limitations in handling noise.  
  2. **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**:  
     - Inspired by stock trading, this method uses exponential moving averages but showed suboptimal results due to its focus on loss minimization.  
  3. **Profit Maximization Algorithm**:  
     - Treats the problem as a constrained optimization task, selecting \( K \) most informative frames based on backtracking.  
     - Results in high-quality frame selection but requires manual tuning of \( K \).  
  4. **Peak Prominence**:  
     - Measures the prominence of peaks to identify significant content transitions.  
     - While effective, this method requires fine-tuning for different video types.
