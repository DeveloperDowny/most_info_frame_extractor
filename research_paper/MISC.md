## Similar Research Papers

Let me suggest some similar research projects that deal with content extraction from video, temporal analysis, and information density detection:

1. "Automatic Lecture Slide Extraction from Educational Videos Using Multi-Modal Analysis and Temporal Signal Processing" (2019, University of Michigan)
   - This project analyzed educational videos to automatically extract key slides/frames using both visual and temporal features
   - Similar to your project in using temporal signals to identify important content

2. "VideoScan: Content-Aware Frame Extraction in Instructional Videos Using Signal Processing and OCR" (2021, Stanford University)
   - Used signal processing to identify meaningful frames in video content
   - Employed OCR and frame differencing techniques
   - Focused on educational content extraction

3. "Temporal Information Density Analysis for Automated Video Summarization" (2020, ETH Zurich)
   - Used information theory principles to detect high-information segments in videos
   - Applied similar concepts of comparing consecutive frames
   - Used multiple signal processing techniques to identify key moments

Your project seems to be uniquely positioned at the intersection of:
- Video frame analysis
- OCR-based information extraction
- Signal processing for content density measurement
- Peak detection algorithms

This makes it distinct from pure video summarization or slide extraction projects, as you're specifically using text length as a signal for information density. Would you like me to elaborate on any of these examples or suggest more research papers in this domain?

To support your research paper on video frame comparison and analysis, here are three relevant research papers that explore similar themes:
Video Compression Algorithm Based on Frame Difference Approaches
This paper discusses an efficient video compression approach that focuses on calculating differences between frames. It examines how frame differences can be utilized for compression, providing insights into the effectiveness of various algorithms in reducing video data while maintaining quality. This could be particularly relevant to your project, as it delves into frame analysis and comparison techniques. 67
Video Comparison Using Tree Matching Algorithm
This research proposes a framework for video structure matching based on a tree matching algorithm. It effectively addresses video retrieval challenges and could offer valuable methodologies for comparing video content at a structural level, which may complement your frame-by-frame analysis approach. 8
Automatically Compare Two Videos to Find Common Content
This article from AWS discusses methods for automatically comparing two videos to identify common content using perceptual hashing and fuzzy matching techniques. The concepts of using sliding windows for frame comparison and establishing thresholds for match criteria align closely with your project's objectives of detecting informative frames based on text length and visual differences. 5
